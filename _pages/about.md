I am a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of London, working in the group led by [Dr. Thomas Haworth](https://thaworth.wixsite.com/astro). My research focuses on characterising the chemical composition of protoplanetary disks, seeking to understand how these environments shape the planets that form within them. I use a comprehensive approach that combines advanced thermochemical models with analysis of observational data from state-of-the-art facilities like [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/) and [APEX](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/apex/).

Currently, I'm exploring how external irradiation affects protoplanetary disk chemistry, shedding light on the impact of the local environment on these planet-forming systems. Through this work, I aim to enhance our understanding of the processes that lead from primordial disks to the fascinating diversity of planetary systems we observe today.

My research interests
 include:
- Planetary formation and evolution
- Astrochemistry
- Sub-millimeter astronomy
- Exoplanet atmospheres
