I am a postdoctoral research fellow in astrophysics at Queen Mary University of London working with Dr. Thomas Haworth. I study the chemical composition of protoplanetary disks, aiming to draw links between the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, and the disks in which they form.Â I use a combination of complex thermochemical models and observational data from facilities such as ALMA and APEX.
