I am a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of London, working in the group led by [Dr. Thomas Haworth](https://thaworth.wixsite.com/astro). My research focuses on the characterising the chemical makeup of protoplanetary disks, aiming to draw links between these planet-forming environments and the composition of planets that form within them. I employ a multifaceted approach, combining sophisticated thermochemical modeling with observational data analysis from cutting-edge facilities such as ALMA and APEX.

Currently, I'm exploring how external irradiation affects protoplanetary disk chemistry, shedding light on the impact of local environment on these planet-forming systems. 

Research interests:
- Planetary formation and evolution
- Astrochemistry
- Sub-millimeter astronomy

Through this research, I aim to enhance our understanding of the chemical pathways that lead from primordial disks to the fascinating diversity of planetary systems we observe today.
